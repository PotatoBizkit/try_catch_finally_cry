# try_catch_finally_cry
*Cracks Neck* *Chuggs Caffeine* Let's make a collection of LeetCode solutions cleaner than my search history, messier than my sleep schedule, optimized for **runtime** but maximized for **existential dread**.

---

## What's Inside
- Grinds of LeetCode problems in Python, sometime in C if I feel a little *fancy* and maybe some tears.
- Solutions cleaner than my search history.
- Occasional one liners no one asked for.

---

## Tech Stack
- ***Languages:*** Python, C (unhealthy doses of caffeine)
- ***Platform:*** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) - the official pain dispenser.

---

## Goal
Commit until I either:
1. Transcend beyond time and space through the sacred art of dynamic programming
2. Achieve algorithmic nirvana where all bugs are illusions and all pointers point to truth.
